/*
NOTES:

To use your own components in the chatbot, first you need to define it in the "widget" section of the config file:
widgetName: The name to which you will refer to the widget when you call createChatBotMessage
widgetFunc: A function which returns the component you want to render. It needs to take in props and spread
the props out over the given component: (props) => <Component {...props} />
props: An array of props you want to pass to the component
mapStateToProps: An list of properties from configuration state property that you want this component to receive as props.

You will then be able to use the widget when you send a response with createChatBotMessage:
createChatBotMessage("Ok, one moment", { 
  widget: "overview"
})
